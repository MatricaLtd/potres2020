# Potres2020 / Earthquake2020

This is an open call for a humanitarian code sprint in Flutter - we need you :heart:

Croatia was hit by one of the largest earthquakes in Croatian history and the impact on the population is significant. The government and the organizations are largely useless so a huge grassroots effort started over the social networks to bring food, heating, water, fuel, sanitary equipment, volunteer construction workers etc to the affected area.:heart:

The effort until now depended on a combination of google spreadsheets, facebook groups, NGOs etc but this quickly proved too much to handle - both in terms of people needing help and people offering it

A local IT company came out with https://potres2020.openit.hr/views/map based on Ushahidi (an open source crisis-responding tool) - but the tool, great as it is, is insufficient for the needs of the people in the field - we need something that's easier and faster to use, spends less internet and less battery (both are in short supply) and provides critical services - such as allowing volunteers to go to gps coordinates of the people that need their help - this is where the Flutter app comes in:

Given the time sensitivity of the tasks (!we are expecting snow next week!) - we are primarily looking for medium and senior developers - people with experience who can get the basic necessary features out on short schedule.

That said - even if you're not a senior - we will try to use your talents to the fullest to make this happen, so please join us at https://t.me/joinchat/GS6d__xrzjMZ9vZa - and let's talk :heart:
